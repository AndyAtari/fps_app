# FPS Tracker

FPS tracker is an application that tracks and manages the performance (frames per second and resolution) of console games. It is built with Ruby on Rails. 

## Motivation

With the new hardware for current gen consoles, many games are receiving performance enhancements. I wanted to create a CMS that tracks all those games so a player can find out if their favorite games are optimized. 

## Installation 

After cloning the repository, 

install bundler: 

```$ bundle```  

## Usage

In your terminal run ```$ rails s``` and start your local server. You can navigate the application through your local port. 

## Roadmap

This is a early work in progress app. I plan on many future updates and commits.

## Contributing 

I welcome and encourage contribution from the video game community.
